## Technologies

* Python 3 - [Installation instructions](https://www.python.org/)  

  It's good practice to work on a virtual environment with it's own depencies and packages.  
  1 - To create a virtual environment on your machine follow the commands below:  

  ```
  $ python3 -m venv env_name
  ```  
  2 - Activate the newly created environment:  

  ```
  $ source env_name/bin/activate
  ```  

  You should see the env_name now on your terminal like in the shown example

  ```
  (env_name) [computer:~/projects/pazul-game]$
  ```

    ### **Dependencies**
    
    * **pytest** 

    To install all dependencies in your virtual environment run the command below:

    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Run pytest  
    Run the following command in your command line:  
    ```
    $ pytest
    ```
